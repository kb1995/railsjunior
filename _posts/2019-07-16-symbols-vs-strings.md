## What is a symbol?

A lot of programming languages don't have symbols - they only have strings. In those languages, strings are used as identifiers as well as storing data. 

Ruby decided to split this logic into two separate types - we use symbols as identifiers and strings are used for working with data.

Without a doubt, if you have ever worked with Ruby or Ruby on rails, you have encountered symbols. They look like this

```rb
:post
:index
:user
```

In general, you should be more interested in understanding what symbols are, not when to use them. Generally, if you understand what they are, chances are that you will be fine.
