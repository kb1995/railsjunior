So you have defined an attr accessor in your model which you want to pass down through a json response. But it doesn't work.

First of all, the reason why it is not working. Attr_accessor defines a getter and a setter methods. Therefore, if we want to retrieve it from our json, we need to define it as a method. You can read more about attr_accessors in my <a href="{% post_url 2020-01-30-getter-setter %}">article</a>.

If you have defined an attr_accessor called <mark>distance</mark>, you can pass the getter method using the following syntax.

```ruby
render json: user, methods: [:distance]
```

Now <mark>distance</mark> is in your json. ðŸŽ‰
